Here is how you be an admininstrator in my Discord channel. You need to be in the group: https://web.roblox.com/Groups.aspx?gid=3128589 Next, you need to be a moderator before you can be administrator. After that, go to the game you became a moderator in. Then answer all the questions and I will answer your request in 1-5 days. Then you will be on discord in 0-1 days.
